  <h2>Support Tiers</h2>
  <div class="notification is-info">
    <strong>Tier I (Universal Support):</strong> All students receive standard classroom instruction and school-wide support.
  </div>
  <div class="notification is-warning">
    <strong>Tier II (Targeted Support):</strong> Some students may benefit from small group interventions or additional check-ins.
  </div>
  <div class="notification is-danger">
    <strong>Tier III (Intensive Support):</strong> A few students may need individualized support from counselors or specialists.
  </div>

  <h2>How Scores Are Calculated</h2>
  <p>
    Your responses (rated 0-4 from "Never" to "Almost Always") are converted to standardized 
    T-scores using research-based norms. These T-scores determine your support tier recommendation:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>T-score ≤ 60:</strong> Normal/No Risk (Tier I)</li>
    <li><strong>T-score 61-70:</strong> At-risk (Tier II recommended)</li>
    <li><strong>T-score ≥ 71:</strong> High risk (Tier III recommended)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> Question 25 (self-harm thoughts) automatically classifies as High risk if answered "Yes", 
    regardless of other scores. If you're experiencing thoughts of self-harm, please speak with a trusted adult immediately.
  </p>

  <h2>Privacy & Confidentiality</h2>
  <p>
    Your assessment results are stored securely and only accessible to authorized school counselors. 
    This information helps them provide appropriate support and resources. Your data will not be 
    shared with anyone else without your consent, except in cases where safety is a concern.
